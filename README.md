## What is this?

If you're unfamiliar with the Pokémon franchise, a Pokédex is an index for fictional creatures called Pokémon.

Hence Poké + index = Pokédex.    

In the games and television series they're commonly depicted as small devices that store Pokémon attributes, type, evolution, and other data.

## How do I use this application?

Simple! Find Pokémon using either the search bar or filtering system.

## Why did you build this?

The first day I came across PokéAPI I was blown away by the amount of data available. 

A lot of ideas came to mind, and after brainstorming I landed on the idea of creating a Pokédex with an emphasis on a clean and simple UI/UX.
